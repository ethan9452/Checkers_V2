# Checkers_V2


This is the second version of my checkers game. The first one kinda sucked; I didn't really think about how to organize it 
so it became too messy to quick.

This time around I'm tryna seperate my code into nice, simple classes that can talk to each other. Hopefully this way I can work on one 
class at a time and not be too confused.
